		<h2 class="title">Hello There</h2>
		<p class="cover">My name is Geoff. I am a 26 year old designer born and raised in Chicagoland with a love for the restaurant scene and a passion for user experience. I saw the position for Product Designer on Dribbble and was immediately drawn to your beautiful minimal design aesthetic as well as your focus on amazing restuarant experiences. 
		<br><br>
		I believe I would make a valuable addition to the team because I have experience in a variety of fields (design, product and development) and I am able to be flexible and agile in my role. With this opportunity, I hope to expand my skill set by working with other talented designers on interesting and beautiful projects. 
		<br><br>
		Below you'll find my resume as well as <a href="#designs">some designs</a> I worked on this weekend for you. </p>
