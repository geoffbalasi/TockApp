		<h2 class="title">Hello There</h2>
		<p class="cover">My name is Geoff. I'm a 26 year old designer born and raised in Chicagoland. I saw the position for Product Designer and immediately knew I wanted to throw my hat in the ring. Your company really appealed to me because I love the restaurant scene (especially the local restaurant scene). Combine that with your beautiful and minimal design asthetic and I needed to know more. 
		<br><br>
		I'm most comfortable working on small teams and because I have experience in many fields I'm able to be flexible in my role. I began working as a software developer after college but was always more interested in the design and process of creating a product, and for the last 2 years i've been doing just that. What i'm looking for now is to work at a world class operation with other talent designers and to continue to improve and expand my skill set. 
		<br><br>
		Below you'll find my resume as well as some designs I worked on this weekend for you. </p>
